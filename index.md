## Nicolas Krause

Hello! This is my website where I put up some of the things I'm working on. By way of introduction I'm an electrical engineering graduate from [UVic](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/current/undergraduate/electrical/index.php) whose just completed my degree. I took the long route to engineering, having initially completed a BA at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Political Science way back in 2010. I've got an Electronics Technologist diploma from [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/electronics-engineering-technology) and I entered UVic through the engineering bridge program at [Camosun](https://camosun.ca/programs-courses/find-program/electrical-computer-engineering-bridge-uvic-advanced-diploma). If you're a student considering any of these options and have some questions please don't hesitate to reach out! You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickKrause1), or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-krause-2b3a1525/). I'm actively looking for work, please contact me if you think we'd be a good fit! 

### Induction Motor Fault Detection - Undergrad Final Project
As part of my Electrical Engineering degree we had to complete a final project, so I did. I was part of a group of five that attempted to detect problems in an electric motor using algorithms. Applying the full bore of technical language one would describe it in the following way. Our group attempted to detect eccentricity faults in voltage and current data from a directly driven induction motor using two different algorithms. One was a binary linear classifier, and the second, which I wrote, used Principle Component Analysis to determine if the motor was in a fault state. Along with two other members of my group, we recently presented our paper at the [PEMD](https://pemd.theiet.org/) conference, held in Newcastle in 2022. You can watch our presentation [here](https://youtu.be/bTWBrqiA1kQ?t=831) and you can read our complete paper [here](https://github.com/FuzzyBunnys/Papers/blob/main/Paper91_PEMD_2022.pdf). 

### Fusor
In my spare time I've been slowly putting together a [fusor](https://fusor.net/), which is a device that lets you fuse atoms in the comfort of your own home. The original inventor of the device, [Philo Farnsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Farnsworth) also invented television! In any case it's a big long project made up of a lot of little projects. Here you can find a listing of all the things I'm working on related to it and the slow progress I'm making. I've been posting updates at [fusor.net](https://fusor.net/board/) for awhile, but this is a centralized source of everything I've done. 
* [Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Thermocouple-Gauge-Sensor/) - In progress

* [Research and Reading](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/FusorResearchReading) - Forever In Progress

### Collatz
To really cement my status as an internet weirdo, in between working on my homebuilt fusor I've also been plugging away at the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). I obviously don't have a proof of it (yet...), but I've discovered some neat things (all likely unoriginal) and written a couple of programs to test some ideas I've had.
* [An Orbit Counting Program in C](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Collatz-Programs/) - Complete
* [A Different Orbit Counting Program in Python](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/A-Different-Orbit-Counting-Program/)- Complete

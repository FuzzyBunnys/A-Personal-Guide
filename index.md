Hello! This is my website where I put up some of the things I'm working on. By way of introduction I'm an electrical engineering student at [UVic](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/current/undergraduate/electrical/index.php) whose just about completed my degree. I took the long route to engineering, having initially completed a BA at [UBC](www.ubc.ca) in Political Science way back in 2010. I've got an Electronics Technologist diploma from [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/electronics-engineering-technology) and I entered UVic through the engineering bridge program at [Camosun](http://camosun.ca/learn/programs/engineering-bridge/admission-requirements/electrical.html). If you're a student considering any of these options and have some questions please don't hesitate to reach out!

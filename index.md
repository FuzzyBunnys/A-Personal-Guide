Hello! This is my website where I put up some of the things I'm working on. By way of introduction I'm an electrical engineering student at [UVic](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/current/undergraduate/electrical/index.php) whose just about completed my degree (I tacked on a minor in Mathematics which extended things a bit). I took the long route to engineering, having initially completed a BA at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Political Science way back in 2010. I've got an Electronics Technologist diploma from [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/electronics-engineering-technology) and I entered UVic through the engineering bridge program at [Camosun](http://camosun.ca/learn/programs/engineering-bridge/admission-requirements/electrical.html). If you're a student considering any of these options and have some questions please don't hesitate to reach out! You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/NickKrause1).  


### Fusor
In my spare time I've been slowly putting together a [fusor](https://fusor.net/), which is a device that lets you fuse atoms in the comfort of your own home. The original inventor of the device, [Philo Farnsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Farnsworth) also invented television! In any case it's a big long project made up of a lot of little projects. Here you can find a listing of all the things I'm working on related to it and the slow progress I'm making. I've been posting updates at [fusor.net](https://fusor.net/board/) for awhile, but this is a centralized source of everything I've done. 
* [Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Thermocouple-Gauge-Sensor/) - In progress
* [Vacuum Chamber](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Vacuum-Chamber/) - Complete
* High Voltage Probe - In Progress
* Turbopump Controller - In Progress
* Simulation - In Progress

### Collatz
To really cement my status as an internet weirdo, in between working on my homebuilt fusor I've also been plugging away at the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). I obviously don't have a proof of it (yet...), but I've discovered some neat things (all likely unoriginal) and written a couple of programs to test some ideas I've had.
* [An Orbit Counting Program in C](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Collatz-Programs/) - Complete
